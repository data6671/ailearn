To build a robust application with the described requirements using FastAPI and Python, we need to carefully design the architecture and organize our codebase in a modular and scalable way. Here's a proposed architecture and folder structure to get you started:  
   
### Architecture Overview:  
1. **Web Scraping Module**: Responsible for scraping data from specified websites.  
2. **Database Module**: Handles all database operations including saving scraped data and user information.  
3. **Data Processing Module**: Processes data (e.g., generating embeddings).  
4. **Email Module**: Manages constructing and sending emails to users.  
5. **API Layer (FastAPI)**: Exposes endpoints for user interaction like registering or setting their preferences.  
6. **Scheduling Module**: Handles periodic tasks such as weekly emails.  
   
### Folder/File Structure Proposal:  
```  
/myapp/  
|-- app/  
|   |-- __init__.py  
|   |-- main.py              # FastAPI application creation and configuration  
|   |-- config.py            # Configuration settings for the app  
|   |-- models.py            # Database models  
|   |-- schemas.py           # Pydantic schemas for request and response data validation  
|   |-- dependencies.py      # Dependency injections (e.g., get database session)  
|  
|-- scraping/  
|   |-- __init__.py  
|   |-- scraper.py           # Web scraping functions and logic  
|  
|-- database/  
|   |-- __init__.py  
|   |-- database.py          # Database connection and session management  
|   |-- crud.py              # CRUD operations for the database models  
|  
|-- processing/  
|   |-- __init__.py  
|   |-- embeddings.py        # Logic for generating and handling embeddings  
|  
|-- email/  
|   |-- __init__.py  
|   |-- email_service.py     # Email construction and sending logic  
|  
|-- scheduler/  
|   |-- __init__.py  
|   |-- scheduler.py         # Setup and manage scheduled tasks  
|  
|-- tests/  
|   |-- __init__.py  
|   |-- test_scraping.py  
|   |-- test_database.py  
|   |-- test_processing.py  
|   |-- test_email.py  
|   |-- test_api.py  
|  
|-- requirements.txt         # Python dependencies  
|-- README.md                # Project overview and setup instructions  
|-- .env                     # Environment variables file  
|-- Dockerfile               # Docker container configuration  
|-- docker-compose.yml       # Docker compose configuration for local development  
```  
   
### Key Modules and Technologies:  
- **FastAPI**: For building the API layer.  
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for interacting with the MySQL database.  
- **Pydantic**: For data validation through schemas.  
- **Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ**: For handling periodic tasks (like weekly emails).  
- **BeautifulSoup or Scrapy**: For scraping websites.  
- **NumPy/SciPy or similar**: For data processing and embeddings.  
- **SMTP library or a service like SendGrid**: For sending emails.  
   
### Suggested Technologies:  
- **Docker**: For containerization, ensuring a consistent environment across development, testing, and production.  
- **GitHub Actions or Jenkins**: For CI/CD pipelines.  
- **pytest**: For running unit tests.  
   
### Pitfalls to Consider:  
1. **Web Scraping Legal Issues**: Ensure that scraping is compliant with the terms of service of the websites and legal regulations.  
2. **Data Consistency**: Regular changes in the structure of source websites can break your scraping logic.  
3. **Email Delivery**: Managing email deliverability and avoiding spam filters can be challenging.  
4. **Scalability**: Ensure that the database and application can handle the load as the number of users grows.  
5. **Security**: Protect user data, especially emails and personal information. Implement proper authentication and authorization if needed.  
6. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging to manage and debug issues in production.  
   
### Development Tips:  
- Start with defining database models and API schemas.  
- Develop and test each
